-- first thing i want --
ability to INPUT age in weeks months or years - show all equivalent values when only typing one value - ageDays(but don't show), ageWeeks, ageMonths, ageYEears
-- BUILT A DATE PICKER WHICH SHOWS WEEKS, MONTHS & YEARS

INPUT - for number of days since last measurement - daysSinceLastMeasurement
-- DONE

INPUT - adjusted age - used for calorie calculation - premature birth age - adjustedAge
-- DONE

INPUT - length entered as cm and inch conversion = current and previous length - currentLengthCm, currentLengthIn, previousLengthCm, previousLengthIn
-- DONE

INPUT - weight entered as kg and lbs & ozs conversion = current and previous weight - currentWeightKg, currentWeightLb, previousWeightKg, , previousWeightLb

INPUT - for adjustedAge make each value adjustable - adjustedAgeWeeks, adjustedAgeMonths, adjustedAgeYears

Need to calculate how much weight they've gained since the last measurement (currentWeightKg - previousWeightKg) * 1000 / ageDays, (currentWeightLb - previousWeightLb)
EQUATION grams per kilograms per day = (current kg minus previous kilograms) * 1000 / # of days since last measurement - gramsPerKgPerDay
This number should be in a certain range (should be adjusted age):
CALCULATE need to know actual grams per kilograms per day value from above ^
preemie <2kg = 15-20 g/kg/day
preemie >2kg = 20-30 g/kg/day
0-4 months = 23-34 g/kg/day
4-8 months = 10-16 g/kg/day
8-12 months = 6-11 g/kg/day
12-16 months = 5-9 g/kg/day
16-24 months = 4-9 g/kg/day
2-6 yrs = 2-3 g/kg/day

------- growth charting --
http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/percentile_data_files.htm
http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/sft_wflh_girls_p/en/

length by weight
weight for age
length for age
if age > 2 years then use CDC growth chart, otherwise use WHO (World Health Organization)

EXAMPLE:
male
20 months old
13 kg
80cm in length
75th percentile weight for age
10th percentile length for age
